## Introduction

HostsFileUpdater is a Python script designed to update host files by replacing the IP address `127.0.0.1` with `0.0.0.0`, excluding commented or empty lines. This tool is particularly useful for modifying host files to block or redirect specific domains.

## Features

- Updates host files by replacing `127.0.0.1` with `0.0.0.0`.
- Skips commented lines and empty lines.
- Provides detailed error messages for easy troubleshooting.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the script and run it using Python.

```bash
python hosts_file_updater.py
```

## Usage

The script takes the path to the hosts file as a parameter. Ensure that the file exists and is writable.

```python
# Specify the path to your hosts file
file_path = "/path/to/hosts.txt"

# Call the function to update the hosts file
update_hosts_file(file_path)
```

## Example

In this example, we have a hosts file (`hosts.txt`). The script will update the file by replacing `127.0.0.1` with `0.0.0.0`, excluding commented or empty lines.

```python
# Specify the path to your hosts file
file_path = "/path/to/hosts.txt"

# Call the function to update the hosts file
update_hosts_file(file_path)
```
